Just an initial test to get my feet wet with putting a code project public and using multi-platform tools.

The dom parser is intended to be used over an ajax call to return information about remote pages.

The returned data ia a JSON array that looks best in a parser such as http://jsonlint.com/

No deep security concerns are addressed, this has never been used in a non-development enviroment.

Please use wisdom and caution!
